# Design Choices

* model.py, a SQLAlchemy model for the schema above.
* crud.py contains functions for users, appointments and reservations.
* server.py is just simple flask routes. No time for fancy JavaScript.
* Database is PostgreSQL. When you got the best, don't mess with the rest.
* Unit Tests for every routine in crud.py.
* seed_database.py offers several customizable settings:
  * SEED_APPOINTMENTS, number of days of future appointments to schedule.
  * APPOINTMENT_DURATION, minutes, flexible design for changes later.
  * SEED_USERS = 50, number of fake users to create
    * Must have enough users to simulate some likely collisions.
  * SEED_RESERVATIONS, number of Reservations to create for EACH user.
